Most people think evaluating AI is just about checking if an answer is correct. In reality, it’s a lot deeper than that. While working on AI response evaluation and prompt engineering projects, I started noticing something interesting. Large language models don’t just generate text. They try to imitate how humans structure ideas, humor, and narratives.

That observation led me to build a small Python tool called Narrative AI CLI. The idea was simple. Instead of only judging whether AI responses are correct, I wanted to analyze how content is written. Is the story linear? Is it branching? Does it wander before reaching a point? Is the tone intentional or accidental?

This project made me explore how storytelling structure affects how AI outputs are perceived. For example, a technically correct answer can still feel wrong if the pacing is off or the reasoning jumps around too much. On the other hand, a well structured response feels more natural and trustworthy.

Through evaluating thousands of AI responses across different platforms, I’ve learned that the best evaluators are the ones who understand both sides of the equation. The technical behavior of the model and the human side of communication such as humor, tone, narrative flow, and creativity.

This is also why prompt engineering isn’t just about writing instructions. It’s about understanding how AI thinks, how it interprets context, and how subtle changes in wording can completely change the quality of the output.

The more I work in AI training and evaluation, the more I see that the future of model alignment will depend on people who can combine technical thinking with deep understanding of content and storytelling.
