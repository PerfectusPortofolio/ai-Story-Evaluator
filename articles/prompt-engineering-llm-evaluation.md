Prompt Engineering for AI Evaluation and Model Alignment

By David Perfectus



Prompt engineering is often misunderstood as simply writing better instructions for AI. In practice, it’s closer to designing experiments that reveal how a model thinks.

When I started working with LLM evaluation tasks, I noticed that small changes in prompts could completely change the quality of responses. A slightly different wording could reduce hallucinations, improve reasoning, or even affect how creative a response becomes.

Over time, I began approaching prompts as tools for testing model behavior. Instead of asking a question once, I would design variations that stress different parts of the model such as logic, narrative structure, or instruction following.

This approach is what inspired some of the ideas behind Narrative AI CLI. I wanted to experiment with how AI interprets storytelling formats like linear narratives, branching structures, or exploratory writing styles.

One important realization is that effective prompts are not always longer or more detailed. Sometimes the best prompts are the ones that guide the model while still leaving enough room for reasoning.

As AI systems become more integrated into real world applications, prompt engineering will play a major role in ensuring models produce useful, safe, and well structured outputs.
